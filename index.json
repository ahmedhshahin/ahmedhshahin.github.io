CT scans of the lungs inform clinical assessment of IPF patients and contain pertinent information related to disease progression. In this work, we propose a multi-modal method that uses neural networks and memory banks to predict the survival of IPF patients using clinical and imaging data. The majority of clinical IPF patient records have missing data (e.g. missing lung function tests). To this end, we propose a probabilistic model that captures the dependencies between the observed clinical variables and imputes missing ones. This principled approach to missing data imputation can be naturally combined with a deep survival analysis model. We show that the proposed framework yields significantly better survival analysis results than baselines in terms of concordance index and integrated Brier score. Our work also provides insights into novel image-based biomarkers that are linked to mortality.","tags":["deep learning","survival analysis","IPF","interstitial lung diseases","neural networks"],"title":"Survival Analysis for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis using CT Images and Incomplete Clinical Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ghadir Ali","Ahmed H.

The mortality rate was estimated to be 5%-10% of hospitalized patients, whereas it rises to 30% for severe cases admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Among all cases admitted to ED, 30% were misdiagnosed, and they did not suffer from pneumonia, which raises a flag for the need for more accurate diagnosis methods. Several methods for pneumonia detection were recently developed using AI in general and more specifically, using deep neural networks. Even though it worth acknowledging the significant limitations and concerns on the generalizability of such models and the barriers facing the employment of this technology for clinical practice. In this paper, an Attention model is used with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for lung pneumonia diagnosis. The backbone of the model is a ResNet50 architecture with an added dual attention layer. The model was trained on the chest x-ray dataset for the aim of chest pneumonia classification. The model achieved an average validation accuracy of 97.82% and AUROC of 0.98842 on our split with cross validation. Regarding the original split, accuracy was 77.63% and AUROC of 0.7967 on the official test set. In summary, incorporation of established computer vision techniques such as Attention modules seems to be a promising approach for advancing medical image analysis.","tags":["medical diagnostic imaging","computer vision"],"title":"Convolutional Neural Network with Attention Modules for Pneumonia Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ahmed H.

Recent studies have shown that extreme points can be effectively used to encode user inputs. A heat map generated from the extreme points can be appended to the RGB image and input to the model for training. In this study, we present FAIRS -- a new approach to generate object segmentation from user inputs in the form of extreme points and corrective clicks. We propose a novel approach for effectively encoding the user input from extreme points and corrective clicks, in a novel and scalable manner that allows the network to work with a variable number of clicks, including corrective clicks for output refinement. We also integrate a dual attention module with our approach to increase the efficacy of the model in preferentially attending to the objects. We demonstrate that these additions help achieve significant improvements over state-of-the-art in dense object segmentation from user inputs, on multiple large-scale datasets. Through experiments, we demonstrate our method's ability to generate high-quality training data as well as its scalability in incorporating extreme points, guiding clicks, and corrective clicks in a principled manner.","tags":["deep learning","computer vision","extreme points","segmentation"],"title":"FAIRS: Soft Focus Generator and Attention for Robust Object Segmentation from Extreme Points","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ahmed H.

The learning-based approach uses annotations to train a model that tries to emulate the expert labeling on a new data set. While tremendous progress has been made using such approaches, labeling of medical images remains a time-consuming and expensive task. In this paper, we evaluate the utility of extreme points in learning to segment. Specifically, we propose a novel approach to compute a confidence map from extreme points that quantitatively encodes the priors derived from extreme points. We use the confidence map as a cue to train a deep neural network based on ResNet-101 and PSP module to develop a class-agnostic segmentation model that outperforms state-of-the-art method that employs extreme points as a cue. Further, we evaluate a realistic use-case by using our model to generate training data for supervised learning (U-Net) and observed that U-Net performs comparably when trained with either the generated data or the ground truth data. These findings suggest that models trained using cues can be used to generate reliable training data.","tags":["deep learning","extreme points","interactive segmentation"],"title":"Extreme Points Derived Confidence Map as a Cue for Class-Agnostic Interactive Segmentation Using Deep Neural Network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ahmed H.

Automatic image segmentation tools play an important role in providing standardized computer-assisted analysis for skin melanoma patients. Current state-of-the-art segmentation methods are based on fully convolutional neural networks, which utilize an encoder-decoder approach. However, these methods produce coarse segmentation masks due to the loss of location information during the encoding layers. Inspired by Pyramid Scene Parsing Network (PSP-Net), we propose an encoder-decoder model that utilizes pyramid pooling modules in the deep skip connections which aggregate the global context and compensate for the lost spatial information. We trained and validated our approach using ISIC 2018: Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection grand challenge dataset. Our approach showed a validation accuracy with a Jaccard index of 0.837, which outperforms U-Net. We believe that with this reported reliable accuracy, this method can be introduced for clinical practice.","tags":["skin lesions","segmentation","melanoma","convolutional neural networks","pyramid pooling modules"],"title":"Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoders with Aggregated Multi-Resolution Skip Connections for Skin Lesion Segmentation","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  **Two**  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
